# Movie-Recommender-System
 First we collect and pre-process the hypertextual data from the IMDb
website and extract information from it. Then we use the movies in the dataset which
already have been assigned labels as a training set and learn a prediction model based on it.
We use this model to provide recommendations of related movies and displaying
information about the movies with the help of BeautifulSoup and provide a GUI based
interface using PyQt.
